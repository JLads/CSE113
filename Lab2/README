lab 2



What I learned:
In this activity I learned to use string inputs and seperate them with fgetsand so forth. I also reinforced my memory of how to format switch statements. 


Bug Report.
Most of my bugs were small things in formatting and syntax mistakes that were resolved by just looking through them. I did have trouble logicing my way though seperating a number into its digits for some of the text book problems but that was remedied by asking classmates and being taught by them. The string input and fgets statements as well as variable setting were useful skills that i am glad to have learned. 


Improvements
I would like to add more functions to the menu in the future maybe and also learn to apply string input more in the future.
