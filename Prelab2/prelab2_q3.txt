The two codes from questions one and two are functionally identical.
They revieve an input and test it against a set of truth declarations
and from that determine what function to run. I personally find that 
I can understand both of these forms of the code, be it switch or if-else.
Both follow a nice logical flow. As I see it, if-else blocks are good for
smaller tests. The thing about them is it has to go through each piece
if-else block to get to the result. A switch can do the tests for equality
all at the same time and hence reach a conclusion much faster for say,
1 billion cases.
