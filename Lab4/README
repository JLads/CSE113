Lab 4 readme
Joseph ladino

Puropose 
This lab was intened to improve structure mechanics and introduce using arrays containing structures. It also had more general practice and introduced basic enumerations. 


What i learned
Here I learned how to use pointers some to alter data at an address from functions and basic enumerations. I have also learned that pointers will be a pain for a while until I get them down.


What to improve 
I would like to improve my ability to think through problems faster and also improve my interpretation of debuggin warnings and errors. They would allow me to speed up my programming.




Note: the script for vector.c and array_struct.c is in lab4_main.script.
